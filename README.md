##  Hi, this is my first app built using Electron and NodeJS:
# Awful Pong. üëç

![Awful Pong](img/awful-pong.png "Screenshot of Awful Pong")

*that's it, it's just pong, and it's awful.*

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game built with Electron. This project serves as my first step into building desktop applications. It was perfect for learning the ropes of Electron app development and understanding the basics of game development using JavaScript.
